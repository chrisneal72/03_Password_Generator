### Description
Basic password generator using random numbers, letters and special characters. This started with just a run through script. I made it into a function and used the button to start the gen process.

First iteration I used Prompts to collect the choices. I have made alterations to get the choices from HTML elements.

I added the copy to clipboard function from a google search. I also did not like that the text stayed highlighted, so I found some lines to deselect the text after the copy.
