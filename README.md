### Description
Basic password generator using random numbers, letters and special characters. This started with just a run through script. I made it into a function and used the button to start the gen process.

First iteration is using Prompts to collect the choices. My intent is to comment that out and use form elements on the page for the user choices.

I have the copy to clipboard button, but it will probably be the last thing I connect.
